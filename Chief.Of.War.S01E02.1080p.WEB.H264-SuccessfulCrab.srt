1
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,111
Kaʻahumanu?

2
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,030
Wait.

3
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:58,577
Maui has opened her skies.

4
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,288
There it is.

5
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,501
Kapuahi?

6
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,588
Can you tell me the story again?

7
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,049
Again? I shouldn't be teaching you at all.

8
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:16,261
The Star Map is a study for men only.

9
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,519
Since when have I cared
what is only for men, uncle?

10
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,690
The Red Star,

11
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,359
Kapuahi,

12
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,153
was a warrior of great accomplishment.

13
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,989
With his red cape of fire,

14
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,409
he travels the heavens in search
of the "waters of life".

15
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,539
He finds it every night,

16
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,666
beyond our skies,

17
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:48,794
and gives it to his love,

18
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,923
so she may rise again every morning,

19
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:55,300
as the sun in our sky.

20
00:02:56,426 --> 00:03:01,223
Our ancestors followed the Star Map
to find these islands,

21
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:07,145
but what lands lie beyond our known skies?

22
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,941
None worth leaving here for.

23
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,048
Wood from the ʻUlu tree.

24
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,136
These canoes are from Hawaiʻi's kingdom.

25
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,893
Find Kaʻahumanu.

26
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,448
What's going on?

27
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,783
We will find out soon enough.

28
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:12,836
Father!

29
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,881
What are you doing here?

30
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,800
You did not send word
that you were coming.

31
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,304
Kahekili has attacked Oʻahu, unprovoked.

32
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,514
War is coming to the islands.

33
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,393
I am here to take you back with me
to Hawaiʻi's Kingdom.

34
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,687
Tonight?

35
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,272
Soon Maui will close its shores.

36
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,193
When that happens,
I will not be able to come here anymore.

37
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,487
Maui and Hawaiʻi are enemies as well.

38
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,240
I am Kahekili's sister.

39
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:45,202
Hawaiʻi would never welcome us now.

40
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,162
You will be welcome.

41
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:53,668
I have promised Kaʻahumanu's hand
in marriage to my Chief.

42
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:54,628
What?

43
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,673
Father,

44
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,342
I would not deny you anything,

45
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,594
but this...

46
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,388
Please,

47
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,891
do not make me do this.

48
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,727
Prepare yourself.

49
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,355
We must leave.

50
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,858
Kaʻahumanu!

51
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:17,985
Leave her, Moku.

52
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,737
She has earned her pain tonight.

53
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,072
We planned for this day.

54
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,118
Not like this!

55
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,036
We must go now, my Chief.

56
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,168
Go with your men.

57
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:39,423
I will prepare Kaʻahumanu and send her.

58
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,342
And you?

59
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,305
I am the royal blood of this kingdom.

60
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,224
My place is here.

61
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,606
Take care of our daughter.

62
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:28,764
Son...

63
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:31,016
You are troubled.

64
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,812
Oʻahu was not preparing
for war against us.

65
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,150
You lied to bring us here.

66
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:43,654
This does not feel like prophecy.

67
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,200
I expect many will see it as you do.

68
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,547
We have waited generations

69
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:08,554
for the Prophesied One to lead us,

70
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,934
but I realized

71
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,397
that he is nothing more than a king

72
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:23,861
who is willing to sacrifice everything
to bring its fulfillment.

73
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:30,492
Where other kings have failed,

74
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,830
I will not.

75
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,486
Keep your eyes here.

76
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,866
Don't give them a reason
to wonder what you're thinking.

77
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,869
They know what I'm thinking.

78
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,079
There's no need for this.

79
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,249
We could leave now.

80
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,628
Not with the Boar Men watching over us.

81
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,131
We are familiar with how to gut pig.

82
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,468
Even roast them over hot rocks.

83
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,595
That's enough.

84
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,014
I know what we must do.

85
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:39,895
Kahekili has ordered me to the temple,

86
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,938
so I will go.

87
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,208
I will alert the King.

88
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:08,192
Wait outside.

89
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,086
Kaʻiana?

90
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,112
Bring him back.

91
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,990
We have man power and full sails.

92
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:40,117
Send men to sweep the eight oceans.

93
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:44,454
There is no need to sail blind, my King.

94
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,541
I know where he is going.

95
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,795
Kaʻiana left Heke to the safety of Maui.

96
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:54,923
His wife, Kupuohi, will go nowhere

97
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,301
without her sister.

98
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,221
Kaʻiana has taken sail for Maui
on the currents of Kaiwi.

99
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,348
We will catch him,
and bring him back alive.

100
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,267
No.

101
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,811
According to my Seers,

102
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,607
it isn't Kaʻiana's breath we need,

103
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,944
it is the mana he carries in his bones.

104
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,572
Bring them to me.

105
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,312
What is that?

106
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:00,906
Forward!

107
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:19,882
The King's men won't be far behind.

108
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:20,926
Move quick!

109
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,220
Heke!

110
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,763
- Heke!
- Heke!

111
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:27,558
Heke!

112
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,726
- Heke!
- Heke!

113
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,233
She's not here.

114
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,152
Kahekili's warriors?

115
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,949
There is no sign of intruders.

116
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,535
We have to hurry.

117
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:50,455
Find them!

118
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,710
Where is she?

119
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:59,547
She is not a careless girl,
we will find her.

120
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:00,590
Here!

121
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:02,634
Last night was the Akua Moon.

122
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,596
Second of the four fullest.

123
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:12,519
The night she gives offerings
to the forest gods for their medicine.

124
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:17,733
Heke is in the valley,
replanting what she harvested.

125
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,652
We will find her at ʻĪao.

126
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:13,830
He's here!

127
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:15,207
He's here!

128
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,164
We must help Kaʻiana.

129
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,876
He will find us.

130
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:02,296
If we fight, we all die!

131
00:16:02,713 --> 00:16:04,214
Kupuohi is right.

132
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:05,674
We go.

133
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,134
We find Heke.

134
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,697
We split up.

135
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,660
I will lead men on the path of the river.

136
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,082
Kaʻiana will not die by your hand.

137
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,416
When he is found,

138
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,877
bring him directly to me.

139
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,401
When we find him,

140
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,363
I will tear his flesh with the tusks
of our guardians.

141
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,353
In and out. No attention drawn.

142
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,440
We don't wanna end up like Captain Cook.

143
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:32,029
Don't fire your weapons unless
absolutely necessary.

144
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,365
We need to fill this
for the rest of our voyage.

145
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:37,701
So keep your eyes open.

146
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,927
Kaʻahumanu,

147
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,721
I've brought fresh candlenut oil.

148
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:00,891
I thought you might need it.

149
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,936
I am not to be married today.

150
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:06,230
No, but,

151
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,607
you go to see the Prophetess,

152
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,818
to prepare for what is to come.

153
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,698
You will soon be the wife of a Chief,

154
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:22,120
don't go to him as a girl of indecision.

155
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:40,180
I know this
is not what you saw for yourself,

156
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,642
but it is what you must do.

157
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,144
I see the storm that stirs inside you.

158
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,523
You're asking me to tame it.

159
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,192
No, Kaʻahumanu.

160
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:58,699
Sometimes the storm is all we have.

161
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:22,407
Taula?

162
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,620
I am Kaʻahumanu,

163
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,082
daughter to the Chiefess Nāmāhana.

164
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,876
I have come to seek your counsel.

165
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:43,262
A relative of the King
can find counsel with his Seers.

166
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,598
Why come to me?

167
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:49,184
I have never lived among the King's court.

168
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,770
They do not govern me.

169
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:57,693
Then ask what you will.

170
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:06,450
My father will have me leave
the sands of my birth

171
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,911
to marry a Chief of Hawaiʻi.

172
00:22:11,582 --> 00:22:13,876
Do you see any happiness for me?

173
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:18,255
Because I see nothing but misery ahead.

174
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:26,972
You will disappoint both your father
and Chief.

175
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:30,475
You will not bear your Chief an heir.

176
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,191
Then all is lost for me.

177
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:42,862
Many paths lead to misery for you,

178
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:45,866
but there is one that leads to freedom.

179
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,160
How can I find it?

180
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,037
You cannot find it alone.

181
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,373
A guardian will come.

182
00:23:16,647 --> 00:23:18,690
I sense a deep fear.

183
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:20,275
In me?

184
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:23,070
My family?

185
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,365
In the gods.

186
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,868
What could the gods fear?

187
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:31,787
You.

188
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:39,378
You will break this world.

189
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:15,265
We feared Kahekili's warriors had you.

190
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:18,644
Why would Kahekili's warriors...?

191
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:22,272
Something happened on Oʻahu.

192
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,443
Where is Kaʻiana?

193
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:06,645
Find him!

194
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:10,417
Are you alright?

195
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:11,835
Leave me.

196
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:13,879
You're hurt.

197
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:21,219
I am hunted by the King's men.
They will kill you if you help me.

198
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,136
Go.

199
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:25,057
I do not want your blood on my hands.

200
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:30,646
And I will not have yours on mine.

201
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,650
I can take you where they won't find you.

202
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,277
Can you walk?

203
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:48,330
Rest here.

204
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:33,500
We are still searching.

205
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,047
Kaʻiana mocks us.

206
00:30:39,715 --> 00:30:42,551
The best of Maui's men cannot find
an injured man.

207
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,222
He is fighting for his life.

208
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:50,893
We will find him.

209
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:03,822
Every minute he's on my island
feels like a rat crawling in my house.

210
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:23,342
I must go.

211
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:25,093
Wait.

212
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:27,429
You are not ready.

213
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:40,192
Why would the King's men hunt you?

214
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:44,696
You bear the family crest of the shark.

215
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:48,408
A guardian of Maui's greatest Chiefs.

216
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,167
Who are you?

217
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:00,003
I am no one.

218
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:03,966
But you know of lineage tattoos
and great Chiefs.

219
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:12,558
My mother is a High Chiefess,
sister of King Kahekili.

220
00:32:13,392 --> 00:32:16,395
I know the royals of the court,

221
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,650
but I've never seen you.

222
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:26,405
I share blood with Kahekili,
but he is no family to me.

223
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:31,869
I was born in a cave, much like this one.

224
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:37,457
Hidden to escape the King's anger.

225
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:38,625
About what?

226
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:41,962
My father.

227
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:48,302
He is a chief of Hawaiʻi's kingdom
and an enemy of Maui.

228
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:53,932
I have lived my whole life
in fear of King Kahekili.

229
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,319
Seems we have suffered the same.

230
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:12,618
I served Kahekili as his War Chief.

231
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:16,622
But I can't serve him anymore.

232
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,253
A War Chief who runs from war.

233
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:27,758
You are a chief of contradictions.

234
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,012
Since you and I both suffer
the influence of Kahekili,

235
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:35,182
perhaps I should know your name.

236
00:33:39,311 --> 00:33:40,562
Kaʻiana a ʻAhuʻula.

237
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,358
Kaʻiana...

238
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:47,819
I am Kaʻahumanu.

239
00:33:48,737 --> 00:33:50,364
Kaʻahumanu.

240
00:34:09,091 --> 00:34:10,300
Can you move?

241
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:19,893
If you are found by the King's men
you will need your senses.

242
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:25,065
It would be wise to wait a little longer.

243
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:37,327
My father was there
when Cook and the Paleskin came.

244
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:41,206
I was a child but I remember

245
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:48,422
the fear in his eyes when he talked
about the power of their weapons.

246
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:55,512
The Paleskins were defeated easily.

247
00:34:57,054 --> 00:35:00,600
You do not worry more will return?

248
00:35:00,601 --> 00:35:03,604
My worries lie here.

249
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:09,484
My family waits for me at ʻĪao.

250
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:17,200
I must get to them
before Kahekili's men find them.

251
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:19,745
Where will you go after?

252
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:24,208
I have a canoe waiting
to take me to my father.

253
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:28,795
Your family can find refuge
in Hawaiʻi's kingdom with me.

254
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:38,222
There's a new life waiting for me there.

255
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:42,851
Perhaps it waits for you too.

256
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:09,752
Don't get the rotten ones, boys.
We need to get fresh fruit.

257
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,129
Remember, this is the stock.

258
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:21,782
Alright, pick up as many as you can.

259
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:23,952
Come on, boys. Bring your bags.

260
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:28,165
Captain.

261
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:39,092
The Paleskins have returned.

262
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:04,952
Marley. What are you doing?

263
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:08,330
Marley, put the musket down.

264
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:15,086
These men are suffering.

265
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:17,548
They're here for food and nourishment.

266
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:22,927
Then why is the rat-face man

267
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:25,848
pointing a stick at us?

268
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:33,187
Marley...

269
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:34,398
No!

270
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:42,614
You may just have brought
the whole island down on top of us.

271
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:45,659
This way!

272
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:49,997
We mean you no harm. Alright?

273
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:20,235
They will be upon us soon.

274
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:35,042
It's John's pistol.

275
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,005
We're getting off this island.

276
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:46,345
What are you doing?

277
00:39:48,472 --> 00:39:50,181
Find my family,

278
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:53,185
and take them to the safety of Hawaiʻi.

279
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,728
You are going alone?

280
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,897
Your family will not leave without you.

281
00:39:57,898 --> 00:39:59,983
Give this to Kupuohi.

282
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:01,777
Kupuohi.

283
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:04,780
I will draw them away.

284
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:06,281
Go.

285
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:09,076
Quickly!

286
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:21,839
We can't wait any longer.

287
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:25,133
Kaʻiana knows the woods.

288
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,135
He's not the only one who could find us.

289
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,388
You stay, I'm going to find him.

290
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:31,682
Nāhi wait.

291
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,935
We will find him.

292
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,313
We just need to wait a little longer.

293
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:02,963
A wife waits.

294
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:06,425
A brother fights to bring him home.

295
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,011
Nāmake!

296
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:11,054
Nāhi!

297
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:20,188
Nāhi!

298
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:21,772
Stop Nāhi!

299
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:22,733
Enough!

300
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:28,780
Kupuohi?

301
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:57,995
Wait.

302
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:01,164
Lost...

303
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:03,541
I'm lost.

304
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:04,918
My crew...

305
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,590
We do not know this man.

306
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:13,343
He should return to his people.

307
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:17,097
The Paleskins have returned,

308
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:19,683
Kahekili's men saw them too.

309
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,396
They could track him to us.

310
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:26,398
We must go.

311
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,193
Come.

312
00:43:42,206 --> 00:43:43,665
Ready to launch!

313
00:43:53,592 --> 00:43:54,510
Forward!

314
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:40,532
This is a fitting death for a traitor.

315
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,470
Find the body.

316
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:47,391
We make sail for Oʻahu.

317
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:20,424
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Settle down, settle down, settle down.

318
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:53,165
There!

319
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:55,250
Maui!

320
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,251
It's alright, lad.

321
00:47:57,252 --> 00:47:58,754
Alright. You're safe with us.

322
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:05,593
We're not turning back. Alright.
We got furs in the cargo, we got...

323
00:48:05,594 --> 00:48:07,679
We got winds to push to the open sea.

324
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,477
You'd be dead if we didn't help,
so consider it a favor returned.
