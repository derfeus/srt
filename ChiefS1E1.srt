1
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:28,237
<i>Our people thrive
in the beauty of our islands.</i>

2
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,119
<i>But we do not stand as one.</i>

3
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:43,585
<i>We are four kingdoms joined by water...</i>

4
00:00:56,515 --> 00:01:02,187
<i>...but we are separated by
cunning Chiefs and powerful gods.</i>

5
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:10,070
<i>They keep us in a cycle of endless war.</i>

6
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,492
<i>The Ancient Prophecy says:</i>

7
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>"A Star with a Feathered Cape will signal
the rise of a great King,</i>

8
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:28,338
<i>who will unite the kingdoms
and end the age of war."</i>

9
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,551
<i>We waited for generations,</i>

10
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,096
<i>until the sign finally came.</i>

11
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,981
<i>But no King has arisen.</i>

12
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,392
Stop!

13
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,686
We found one!

14
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,331
That's a big one, Kaʻiana.

15
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,500
It's an omen.

16
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,093
Prepare the ʻawa root.

17
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,431
Give me the noose

18
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,392
and ready a fish.

19
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,619
Throw the ʻawa deep!

20
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,598
This is a good omen, right?

21
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,597
The ʻawa in the water won't sedate
the shark much longer.

22
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,552
Rope! Rope!

23
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:06,890
Pull! Pull!

24
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,569
ʻAwa! ʻAwa!

25
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,494
Paddle!

26
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,745
Paddle!

27
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,753
In your death may life be preserved.

28
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:25,886
Stop!

29
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,139
Get out!

30
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:30,807
Get out, you stray dogs!

31
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,520
My food!

32
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,481
Get out!

33
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:01,004
The villagers call you outcasts,

34
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,215
strangers to Kauaʻi.

35
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,803
But your feather cape bears
the royal colors of Maui.

36
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,180
You are a Chief.

37
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:12,724
So why do you live like this?

38
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,646
The villagers are right about us, boy.

39
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:22,568
But I am no Chief,
and Maui is no longer my home.

40
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:30,784
You really won him over.

41
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,081
You'll need to get better with kids.

42
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:37,708
Why?

43
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,543
Because I want one.

44
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,841
Talk to your sister,
the Kauaʻi sun is getting to her.

45
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,137
I think a baby is a great idea.

46
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,098
We can't.

47
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,726
Nāhi hates kids.

48
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,815
Your brothers will be fine,

49
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:08,155
and you will make a good father.

50
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,265
The canoe is from Maui.

51
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,479
They're here for us?

52
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,108
If they are, there is nowhere to hide.

53
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:07,339
Kaʻiana, when you sought refuge here
three seasons ago,

54
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:13,220
you promised Kauaʻi's queen no trouble
with Maui.

55
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:17,516
Honor that promise.

56
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,982
Kaʻiana.

57
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,277
Son of Maui's great War Chief,

58
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,613
and deserter of the King's army.

59
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:39,621
So this is what you abandoned
your lands and title for?

60
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,503
Your king has need for you at his council.

61
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:49,006
What need?

62
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,468
I don't know what is tolerated among
the Chiefs of Kauaʻi,

63
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,806
but to ignore a royal messenger of Maui,

64
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:03,145
is to sacrifice the tongue of the man
who dared it.

65
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,730
At King Kahekili's request,

66
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:10,694
you will meet us on Maui shores tomorrow.

67
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:21,413
When you left Maui's army,

68
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,667
I vowed to feed your heart to the pigs.

69
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:30,589
You live today only by the mercy
of your king.

70
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,343
I am the one who found you, Kaʻiana.

71
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,514
If you run, I will find you again.

72
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,134
They are waiting.

73
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:40,969
They can wait.

74
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,893
No more delay.

75
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,689
Your offering is ready for the King.

76
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:12,626
Some of the men questioned
whether or not you would come.

77
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,006
Why am I here, Kūpule?

78
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:25,055
You have made us wait, and now
you question why you have been called?

79
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,517
All will be made known, Kaʻiana.

80
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:33,772
My father waits at the warrior fields,
I've come to escort you.

81
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,784
I used to watch you train
with your father when I was a kid.

82
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:51,748
I always knew Maui would never fall

83
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,961
as long as you would lead us.

84
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:01,425
It is good to have you back.

85
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,635
I'm not back.

86
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:52,786
An expected welcome to a dog Chief
who abandoned his post.

87
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,205
Blunted spears?

88
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:59,334
You don't train them in the old way?

89
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,629
Nui would tear through our men otherwise.

90
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,925
No man can reach him behind his spears,

91
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,012
let alone defeat him in combat.

92
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:32,951
Listen!

93
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,537
Kaʻiana will face Nui in the old way,

94
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,456
the way of battle.

95
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:40,709
Bring the spears of war!

96
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,925
It is thunder that shakes the skies.

97
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,802
So we kneel before

98
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,931
the voice of the god
who makes the skies tremble.

99
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,453
Enough formalities.

100
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,372
Stand Kaʻiana.

101
00:18:43,332 --> 00:18:46,084
Share Aloha with your uncle.

102
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:55,302
Spears brush past you like the wind.

103
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,680
Just like your father.

104
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:05,521
Your father preserved my kingdom
more than once as Chief of War,

105
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:10,275
and I miss him every day.

106
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,401
Nāmake!

107
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,487
Nāhi!

108
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,197
I've missed you.

109
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:24,873
Kaʻiana may fight like your father,

110
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:31,255
but your old man gave you his ugly...

111
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,218
...and I miss that the most.

112
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:44,852
You honor him by joining me again.

113
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:51,650
We are here at your request,

114
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:57,489
but we will return to the quiet of Kauaʻi.

115
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:03,620
Beautiful.

116
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:09,585
You needn't be concerned, Kaʻiana.

117
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:14,631
You had your reasons for leaving my army.

118
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,968
I hold no animosity for that.

119
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,511
Come.

120
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,751
Why have you sent for us?

121
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,088
There is a great threat
facing our kingdom.

122
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,842
Our Seers have foreseen

123
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:02,720
the enslavement of our people

124
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,765
under the rule of Oʻahu.

125
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:12,731
Our spies report their army
is twice the size of ours.

126
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:18,028
Why would Oʻahu sail against you?

127
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,782
King Hahana is just a boy.

128
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:25,868
He has always pledged his loyalty
to King Kahekili,

129
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:29,665
and Maui has left his kingdom unprovoked.

130
00:21:30,832 --> 00:21:33,626
Oʻahu's High Priest is a dangerous man,

131
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:37,840
and has poisoned the young King's mind.

132
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,052
He now moves to take our kingdom.

133
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,305
War brings honor to kings

134
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:49,268
and death to the innocent.

135
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,896
We are done killing.

136
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,150
Wait, Kaʻiana.

137
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:02,322
This is about the Ancient Prophecy.

138
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:13,792
The Prophecy is upon us.

139
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:18,796
Our Royal Seer spoke your name

140
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,924
in a vision.

141
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:24,386
The omens are clear, Kaʻiana,

142
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:29,432
we can only defeat Oʻahu

143
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,895
with you by my side.

144
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,661
Kahekili has called us to war.

145
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,792
Did you accept?

146
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:02,591
We tested him by leaving his army
once before.

147
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,385
He will not allow it again.

148
00:23:06,762 --> 00:23:11,308
Then we will begin preparations
to sail back to Kauaʻi.

149
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:13,101
We are going to run away again?

150
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:15,646
Maui is our home, Kaʻiana.

151
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,651
This is our chance to return.

152
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:26,156
I will not lead this family
into another needless war.

153
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,911
What if this is as Kūpule says
and the Prophecy is upon us?

154
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:35,040
Is this not what we have been waiting for?

155
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,917
A chance for peace?

156
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:41,004
King Kahekili has never pursued peace.

157
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:44,383
If Kahekili can unite the kingdoms,

158
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:47,094
maybe he is the Prophesied King.

159
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,847
It cannot be Kahekili.

160
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:48,822
Kaʻiana.

161
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,041
You came alone?

162
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:02,419
What need have I for protection here?

163
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:06,840
Your father was my best friend.

164
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,053
Despite our differences,

165
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,265
I have always seen you as family.

166
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,603
I have something to show you.

167
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:26,902
I know why you left my army, Kaʻiana.

168
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:32,699
I put glory and pride over the people,

169
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,161
and many died in service of my greed,

170
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:40,082
including your father.

171
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:43,836
But this war with Oʻahu will be different.

172
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:47,798
It is the same war we have always fought.

173
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,843
One kingdom's rule over another.

174
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,596
No, this is Prophecy.

175
00:25:57,015 --> 00:26:02,479
The Prophesied One is said
to "rise under the Burning Star,

176
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,567
clothed in a sacred
Feather Cape of the Gods."

177
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:11,446
I was only a boy, but we all saw the sign.

178
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:14,950
Yet no king has come.

179
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,411
I thought the same, Kaʻiana.

180
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:23,166
But my god has shown me a vision.

181
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:33,594
What is this?

182
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:37,306
I would have spared you this,

183
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:42,603
but there is something you deserve to see.

184
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:03,081
As is the ancient custom,

185
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:06,919
Oʻahu's High Priest sought

186
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:10,255
the bones of an enemy Chief,

187
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,175
to sacrifice on his altar of war.

188
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,472
Your father.

189
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:21,099
We stopped them,

190
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:26,355
but not before they desecrated his bones.

191
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:30,734
I give them to you so you may honor him.

192
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,656
The omens are clear, Kaʻiana.

193
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:42,246
The Prophecy does not foretell
the rise of a king,

194
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:46,667
it predicts the birth of a moment.

195
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:51,129
And the moment is now.

196
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:57,845
You are my Feathered Cape
and I am the Burning Star.

197
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:05,811
Together we can end
this needless fighting,

198
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:08,272
and the chaos it brings.

199
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:11,316
Stand with Maui,

200
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:15,320
and fight by my side.

201
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:04,221
Taula.

202
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:11,019
A man of indecision
is a danger to himself,

203
00:30:11,603 --> 00:30:14,439
and to those who follow him.

204
00:30:17,192 --> 00:30:19,736
Did the King send you?

205
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:24,241
I speak only for the gods.

206
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:28,829
I did not come here
for your fortunes or prophecies.

207
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:34,626
The gods have shown me
a vision of your path all the same.

208
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:41,592
You will see the Prophecy fulfilled,
Kaʻiana,

209
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:45,512
and stand with the Prophesied One.

210
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:50,893
The path is dark and unclear,

211
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,313
but you will not walk it alone.

212
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:57,649
You speak in riddles.

213
00:30:58,901 --> 00:31:02,196
I see only what the gods reveal.

214
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:04,823
Nothing more, nothing less.

215
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:08,952
The path is yours to find.

216
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,539
Take your father's hand, Kaʻiana,

217
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,125
and follow where it leads.

218
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,831
Your brothers are looking for you.

219
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,168
Something happened.

220
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:04,633
You wear your thoughts.

221
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,885
You always have.

222
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:10,889
There are no secrets, your eyes tell all.

223
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:14,977
I saw Taula.

224
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,397
The Prophetess?

225
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,233
She told me

226
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:24,736
to take my father's hand,

227
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:28,991
but I don't know what that could mean.

228
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:36,248
Prince Kūpule sent warriors
to deliver your father's things.

229
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:42,880
Your father's hand...

230
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:46,758
Maybe King Kahekili's Seers are correct,

231
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:50,303
perhaps you are needed
to bring about the Prophecy

232
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:52,723
our people have been waiting for.

233
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:59,437
We killed Chiefs, warriors,
and common men,

234
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:02,232
for this king who lost his way.

235
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,902
If we do this,

236
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,237
I will be in service of Kahekili
once again.

237
00:33:08,238 --> 00:33:10,698
You will be in service of The Prophecy,

238
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:12,075
and your people.

239
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:15,162
As you have always been.

240
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:20,000
You have your father's "hand",

241
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:25,506
the choice is yours.

242
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:49,672
So you've come.

243
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:54,636
None of my servants make
the candlenut relish the way I like it.

244
00:34:55,304 --> 00:34:57,681
I have to gather the nuts myself.

245
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,980
We can conquer Oʻahu
with little bloodshed,

246
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,608
and spare the young King.

247
00:35:08,734 --> 00:35:11,527
Invade Oʻahu?

248
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:17,326
Take your warriors to Waikīkī,
but do not attack.

249
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:22,414
Oʻahu's army will gather
to protect their shores.

250
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:24,708
And you?

251
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,419
I will attack the eastern stronghold,

252
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:31,381
and seize the High Priest
at the Temple of Refuge.

253
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:37,095
When the temple falls,
the young King will surrender.

254
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:43,018
If this is Prophecy,
let it begin with the fall of Oʻahu.

255
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,348
Where did you get maile?

256
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,351
I hiked to the valley last night.

257
00:36:24,852 --> 00:36:28,522
I asked the gods to keep you safe.

258
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:35,696
I made this so you could
wear that prayer on your shoulders.

259
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:47,332
You will be safe here, sister.

260
00:36:55,757 --> 00:37:01,930
We will return when Oʻahu is ours.

261
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:24,638
Advance!

262
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,099
Forward.

263
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:50,455
Forward.

264
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,557
Send the rain of spears!

265
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:15,355
Let the slings fly!

266
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:48,509
We have the beach!

267
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:53,805
Tend to the wounded.

268
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:55,682
Stay alert.

269
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,021
It's not safe for the King
to come to shore yet.

270
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,399
We must get to the temple
and find the High Priest.

271
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:20,726
A digging stick.

272
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:24,855
These people aren't warriors.
They're farmers.

273
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,252
Sound the Call of War!

274
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,095
The King is coming.

275
00:43:57,596 --> 00:43:59,389
He is not supposed to be here.

276
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:14,047
Kill them all.

277
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:18,552
This is the Temple of Refuge, my King.

278
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:21,388
A sanctuary and sacred burial ground.

279
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:26,310
Then their bodies won't
have to be taken far.

280
00:45:26,643 --> 00:45:27,644
Go!

281
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,473
Sound the Call of Victory.

282
00:46:39,716 --> 00:46:41,969
Have you found the High Priest?

283
00:46:43,345 --> 00:46:46,098
We have the young King.

284
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:26,138
Why have you attacked my kingdom?
You were like a father to me.

285
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,143
I wanted to be a great king like you,

286
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:34,271
a child of thunder.

287
00:47:35,814 --> 00:47:37,649
Only I

288
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:41,862
can hear the voice in the thunder.

289
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:11,266
Thank you, Kaʻiana.

290
00:48:13,477 --> 00:48:16,355
It is as my Seers have said,

291
00:48:17,022 --> 00:48:19,983
you have given me Oʻahu.

292
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:22,861
It is mine.

293
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:26,281
Where is Oʻahu's High Priest?

294
00:48:27,616 --> 00:48:31,286
This was never about him,
it was about you.

295
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,040
All the omens and gods

296
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:39,419
chose you for this.

297
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:41,295
Not like this.

298
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:44,341
This was the desecration of a kingdom,

299
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:49,012
their bones... like the bones of my father.

300
00:48:49,263 --> 00:48:51,640
This is Prophecy,

301
00:48:52,474 --> 00:48:57,478
and together,
the Star with the Feather Cape,

302
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:00,107
will soar above all kingdoms,

303
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:03,735
and unite them as one.

304
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:10,617
Kaʻiana.

305
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:14,788
My father lied to both of us.

306
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:18,791
I learned the truth of our invasion

307
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,836
after we took the temple.

308
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,131
Oʻahu's blood is on your father's hands.

309
00:49:25,257 --> 00:49:26,258
And ours!

310
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:35,559
Put eyes on him.

311
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:39,229
But take no action without my counsel.

312
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,334
Don't look at them, Kaʻiana,

313
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:02,461
look at me.

314
00:50:04,505 --> 00:50:06,590
We came as a family,

315
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:10,344
and we will face what's ahead together.
