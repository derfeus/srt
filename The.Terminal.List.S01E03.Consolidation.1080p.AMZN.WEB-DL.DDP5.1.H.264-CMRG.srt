1
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,072
- Thank you.
- Madam Secretary.

2
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,715
- Good morning.
- Madam Secretary.

3
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:42,288
I've devoted my career
to reducing casualties

4
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,747
and improving mental health

5
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,416
<i>in the armed services.</i>

6
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:48,252
<i>But while we're achieving
success with our conventional</i>

7
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,672
<i>forces, the physical
and psychological burden</i>

8
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,716
<i>is falling
on the Spec Ops community</i>

9
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,094
<i>to a degree that feels...
unsustainable.</i>

10
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,847
Much as we'd like
our elite warriors

11
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,017
to be machines, they are not.

12
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,436
We are going to overhaul
our budget request

13
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,062
before it goes
to appropriations.

14
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:08,397
Uh, overhaul in what capacity?

15
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,650
<i>Significant reductions
in lifetime deployments</i>

16
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,152
<i>for our special operators.</i>

17
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:16,488
- So, recalculating allowances?
- No.

18
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,866
I'm talking hard caps.
Mandatory retirements.

19
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,285
<i>We can't keep riding them
till there's nothing left.</i>

20
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,579
We'll be facing a significant
degradation in readiness.

21
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,540
- And the financial implication...
- We'll find acceptable levels.

22
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,919
We've been working
on the budget since June, ma'am.

23
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,897
You're suggesting we restructure
in a matter of days?

24
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:34,465
All right. Call home,
let your families know

25
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,175
they're running solo
the next few nights.

26
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:39,428
These operators give their
whole lives to fight for us.

27
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,805
We can give up a weekend
to fight for them.

28
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,307
Let's go.

29
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,441
This is about James Reece,
isn't it?

30
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:55,694
He's one data point.

31
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,090
Yeah, so, if we don't get
this done in the next 12 hours,

32
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,257
BuzzFeed is gonna beat us to it,

33
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,759
and it's gonna be
fucking embarrassing.

34
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,511
I'm sorry, guys. I have
another meeting, but thank you.

35
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,828
Get to it. Good job.

36
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,705
Thank you, okay?

37
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,548
How could they miss this?

38
00:04:57,631 --> 00:05:00,092
I spoke with
a Dr. Russell in Incirlik.

39
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,695
Apparently he pressed
for more testing,

40
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,470
but Reece
checked himself out A.M.A.

41
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,597
Said he had to be back
for the funerals.

42
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,617
- Wait, so no one in the Navy has seen this.
- Yeah, they got

43
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,476
this guy running around,
leading a platoon,

44
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,228
and his medicals are optional?

45
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,604
That's absolute negligence.

46
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,024
Okay.

47
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,734
So what now?

48
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,545
Well, Reece wants to meet.
I want to know why.

49
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:19,987
Either way,
I'll have something set

50
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,131
to drop later this evening.

51
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,156
All right.

52
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,365
Are you being safe on this?

53
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:24,742
I was on the ground

54
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,052
in Sirte when they came
for Gaddhafi.

55
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,453
I think I got this.

56
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,539
Maybe I come with you.

57
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:33,125
And we never see
or hear from Reece again?

58
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,752
No.

59
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,087
He trusts me.

60
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,833
I need that seat.

61
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,262
All right, Reece,
why did you want to meet?

62
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,806
Have you ever heard
of Saul Agnon?

63
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,767
Or a company called
Capstone Industries?

64
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,161
Hi, guys.
May I take your order?

65
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,645
Uh, yeah.

66
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,690
I'll have the little gems
and the striped bass.

67
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,084
- Of course.
- Nothing for me, thank you.

68
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:23,152
He'll have the bucatini.

69
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,445
Of course, right away.

70
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:26,947
Capstone Industries?

71
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,700
Kind of place that only has
a logo on their website.

72
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,452
Agnon, he's the VP
of Asset Management.

73
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,247
I did a little research
of my own, and all their market

74
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,790
investments,
it's, it's, it's fluff.

75
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:40,002
It's Carnival Cruise Lines,
Planet Fitness, H&M...

76
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,546
Wait, so now the backers of
Planet Fitness are involved?

77
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,964
Just listen.

78
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:47,718
The point being,
they have an investment pool

79
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,803
of $60 billion.

80
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,431
That's way more than can be
accounted for in public holding.

81
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,867
Well, where do
they have the remainder?

82
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,393
That's what we need to find out.

83
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,063
What about the Iranians?

84
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,608
It was never about Kahani.
He was, he was top-shelf bait.

85
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,318
This...

86
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,111
it's something domestic.

87
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,988
Something corporate.

88
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,615
And it's not over.

89
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,622
This lead on Capstone,
where did it come from?

90
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,582
- Not important.
- It's important, actually.

91
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,518
If I'm gonna run with
information, I need to know

92
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,836
that I can trust the source.

93
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,172
I'm the source.

94
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,139
There's something
I need to show you.

95
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,975
Um... I pulled this
from the Engram Clinic.

96
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,102
I didn't want to show it to you

97
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,772
until I had some context.

98
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,158
It's a tumor, Reece.

99
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,370
It's, um,
about the size of a walnut.

100
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,455
It's on the node between

101
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,916
the hippocampus
and the amygdala.

102
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,751
I spoke with a neurologist,
and she said

103
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,545
that symptoms would
include headaches...

104
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,966
...paranoia, memory confusion.

105
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,263
That's not me.

106
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,723
It's time-stamped
to your arrival at the clinic.

107
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:17,891
Did NCIS give this to you?

108
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,978
No. Holder never mentioned it.

109
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,289
Right now, I'm pretty sure that
we're the only ones who know.

110
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,816
The neurologist recommended
biopsy.

111
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,486
Without that, there's no way
to accurately diagnose.

112
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,947
And, um, we both know
that you've

113
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,700
been having
confabulatory episodes.

114
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,077
That's not something
that you could explain

115
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,039
with, uh, Jahan Kahani
or with Capstone.

116
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,126
Look in the mirror behind you.
There's a man,

117
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,544
brown cap, wrap-around shades.

118
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,130
- You see him?
- No.

119
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,053
There's just some people
finishing their lunch.

120
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,092
We got to go. Now.

121
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:55,053
Wait, Reece! Hey.

122
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,722
You have to...

123
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,691
Reece! Reece, wait!

124
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,401
Did you bring your smart phone?

125
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,069
No. Just the burner.
What's going on?

126
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,864
They have eyes in the sky.

127
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,825
- You mean like a drone?
- The man that I just saw is an operator.

128
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,785
Now, he's either here for me...

129
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:20,203
or for you.

130
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,622
Reece, there's nobody there.
You're imagining things.

131
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,708
I ran an SDR to get here.

132
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,477
The only way they could've
tracked me is with UAV.

133
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:27,836
Hold.

134
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,591
This is my ride. Get in.

135
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,468
Get in!

136
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,348
Buckle up.

137
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:40,950
I'm sorry, we're running away
because you think

138
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,352
you saw a guy
in wrap-around shades?

139
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,437
We're not running.

140
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,066
Hold on.

141
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,781
Stay here.

142
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,657
You okay, buddy?
I didn't see you there.

143
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,913
Read that.

144
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:46,748
Open it!

145
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,584
That's a professional
target package.

146
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,171
Still think I'm losing my mind?

147
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,202
- We need to tell the police what happened.
- No cops.

148
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:26,371
Reece, that guy came
at you in broad daylight.

149
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:28,915
NCIS is compromised.

150
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,876
Maybe elements in PD,
we can't be sure.

151
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,086
Right now,
we need to get off the grid.

152
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,891
You know how
to use one of these?

153
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,226
Yeah.

154
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,871
Can't be sure
if you're a known quantity.

155
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,497
You need to lay low
until this thing blows over.

156
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,731
Do you have a place to go?

157
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,903
- Do you?
- Yeah.

158
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,121
I'm sorry I got you into this.

159
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,956
You won't see me again.

160
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,333
Reece.

161
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,796
Give me what you have
on Capstone.

162
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,549
If there's a connection to
you and your men, I'll find it.

163
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,618
You know how to reach me.

164
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,825
All clear!

165
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,744
Crash it!

166
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:37,168
On me!

167
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,464
On you.

168
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:45,468
All clear!

169
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,228
Clear!

170
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,897
- Blue! Blue! Blue!
- Blue! Blue!

171
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,402
Going in!

172
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:07,407
All clear, last room.

173
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,534
- What the fuck was that, Hargrove?
- Sir?

174
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:11,698
You were on the door.
You should have taken the room.

175
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,956
I'm not paying you
to jerk me off, okay?

176
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,459
I need verisimilitude.
You understand?

177
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,753
Pull that shit again,
you're fucking gone.

178
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,722
Combined accuracy was
83rd percentile.

179
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,557
Speed, 71st.

180
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,476
Not your best run,
but competitive.

181
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,978
Certainly wouldn't want
to be an enemy combatant.

182
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:40,899
Anyway, my reactions
are still for shit.

183
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,193
You want to run it again, sir?

184
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,986
Uh, wish I could.

185
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,113
No. Lunch break's over.
Come on, let's go.

186
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,491
Steve.

187
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,243
- 2:00 p.m. with Janet Lansing.
- Steve...

188
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,286
2:45, al Khalif.

189
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,080
3:30, the Rexeon board.

190
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,915
4:30, Suri Ratanavanh.

191
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,418
- Ratanavanh? Kill that. One minute.
- Steve?

192
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,503
- Call Gary Mathis...
- We need to talk.

193
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,505
I said wait, Saul.
Tell him we're divesting.

194
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,258
If they need someone to scream
at, they can find a wall.

195
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,155
<i>Send him in.</i>

196
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,876
You're supposed
to be in Santa Barbara.

197
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,628
We have a situation.

198
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:28,423
Is it that you're not
in Santa Barbara?

199
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,345
What sort of situation?

200
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,306
The kind you don't say
out loud for fear

201
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,325
of someday hearing it played
back to you in a courtroom.

202
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,059
Well, we're secure here.

203
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,775
Gordo's dead.

204
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,610
Reece isn't.

205
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,464
- I'll deal with that.
- This was supposed to be

206
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,490
done in Syria.

207
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,409
Now we got this psychopath
running around California.

208
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:57,970
He's not a psychopath.
He's a SEAL Commander.

209
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,204
Have some respect.

210
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,169
This is bad, Steve.

211
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,005
If Reece is out there,
and Holder's a breach...

212
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,316
Holder didn't know
anything actionable.

213
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,383
He knew me. I'm actionable.

214
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,344
So speak to Hargrove.

215
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,471
He'll set you up
with a detail for the trip.

216
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,640
I'm not going
to Santa Barbara, man.

217
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,934
Mike Tedesco can sell
his own goddamn company.

218
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,477
Mike's not a salesman.

219
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,979
He has aspirations.

220
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,900
Look, it's time
to focus now, Saul, okay?

221
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:31,861
The Plano deal has to make.
It has to.

222
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,113
Capstone has sunk
too much money into Nubellum.

223
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,740
The time to sell is right now.

224
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,283
I'm sick of waiting
for Elias Ryberg

225
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,285
to grow some nuts,
and I need you there.

226
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,412
Okay?

227
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,081
You're my closer.

228
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,086
Kurt, send Janet in.

229
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,687
- Oh.
- You should come to bed.

230
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,900
I can't. I have homework.

231
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,985
Hmm.

232
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,698
WARCOM's got you...

233
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:01,159
jumping over bonfires now?

234
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,786
That's a Zoroastrian
new year celebration, Newroz.

235
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,998
Well, I can see how that's
operationally relevant.

236
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,335
They got us tagged
to the Syrian Defense Force.

237
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,046
Got to learn a thing or two
about Kurdistan.

238
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,255
She's kicking.

239
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,967
Is she?

240
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,845
Wait a minute.

241
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,889
Oh...

242
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,060
- Daddy's little ass-kicker.
- No.

243
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,978
She gets her ass-kicking
from her mama.

244
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,776
You know if you get stuck
out there, I'll be okay.

245
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:38,029
My mom and dad will
come down and help.

246
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,117
If I do make it back,

247
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,921
then I'll probably
just go fishing, I guess.

248
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,666
Even if I have
to liberate a bird...

249
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,418
and fly myself home,
I'm gonna be here.

250
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,046
I'll be holding
your hand the whole way.

251
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,590
Well, I guess then I'll be
the only girl with a doula

252
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,759
coming straight from the sandbox.

253
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,851
Oh...

254
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:22,699
Is she going to be okay, Daddy?

255
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,702
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine.
She's just, she's stunned.

256
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,665
She's gonna, she's gonna
fly back to her family.

257
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,601
Coming at you.

258
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,729
Oh, thank you.

259
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,814
Yeah.

260
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,651
Oh, I see you've sprung
for the honeymoon suite.

261
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:02,363
Mm. All right. You were right.

262
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:05,366
NCIS put a BOLO out last night.

263
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,036
So, if I were you,
I wouldn't go home anytime soon.

264
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,204
Oh, and that, uh,
your shooter in L.A.?

265
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,373
Locals ID'd him
as Adrian Gordon is.

266
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,125
Former MARSOC, or Raiders,

267
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,228
or whatever the fuck
they're calling themselves now.

268
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,546
Went private
with Talos Tactical.

269
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,050
I haven't dealt with them
directly, but I think it's safe

270
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,969
to say they don't operate
with a moral fucking compass.

271
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:27,638
Jesus fuck.
Like, just take a breath.

272
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,392
I don't think the burrito's
going anywhere, brother.

273
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,895
I didn't get my bucatini, man.

274
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,438
I don't know what that means.

275
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,982
It means thank you
for this burrito.

276
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,859
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

277
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,959
Luce.

278
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,378
She had some skills, huh?

279
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:02,215
Yeah. She could sing, too.

280
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,300
And hold a barre chord.

281
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:11,599
Yeah, she was
something, brother.

282
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,878
You know, for the life of me,
I can't remember the day

283
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,070
she drew this picture.

284
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,448
Bro, I don't remember
last Sunday.

285
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,828
It was the morning
before Syria, I think.

286
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,622
And, uh...

287
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,415
there was a bird.

288
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,417
A starling, maybe?

289
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,586
Cracked into the window,
killed itself.

290
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,256
- Sounds like your memory's spot on.
- Mmm.

291
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:45,007
It's there, but only half there.

292
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,801
The other parts...

293
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,886
it's fucking... it's muddled.

294
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:55,143
Mixed with other memories,
it's like...

295
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:58,187
like looking
through a kaleidoscope.

296
00:23:59,814 --> 00:24:02,775
Well, you did
get fucking rocked.

297
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:05,069
I mean, you still getting
those headaches, huh?

298
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,450
No.

299
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,331
- Did you see the target package?
- Yeah.

300
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,209
Yeah.

301
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,919
I mean...

302
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,754
looks like a complete asshole.

303
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,756
You see his little fucking dog?

304
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:29,319
I mean, what I'm saying is,
I don't really get

305
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,012
a mastermind vibe with this guy.

306
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,556
Yeah. I didn't think so, either.

307
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,558
I'm also gonna take
a dive into Capstone.

308
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,352
We could, but I do already
have someone working on it.

309
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:40,354
There's a journalist.

310
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:41,981
And she can help me
do some research

311
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,399
without raising suspicion.

312
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,484
- Journal?
- Yeah.

313
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:48,321
Hmm. That's good to know.

314
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,449
She know you're here?

315
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,409
- No.
- She know I'm here?

316
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,495
- Of course not.
- You do know you're not the only one on the line, right?

317
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,348
That I am fucking CIA,
and if it gets out that

318
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,809
- you're trying to fucking wage your own war...
- I understand.

319
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,793
- ...in the streets of L.A...
- I'm telling you,

320
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,879
you're clean. I promise you.

321
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,591
You're good. She's an asset.

322
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,886
I know what category
to put her in.

323
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,888
And there's never been
an obligation.

324
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,371
- If you need to walk, I get it.
- Fuck you, I'm not walking.

325
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:20,603
This isn't an obligation
for me, brother.

326
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:23,481
I just need to know
we have each other's backs.

327
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,192
- That's it.
- Always.

328
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:29,654
All right.

329
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,784
All right.

330
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,245
There's obviously a bunch
of fucking people

331
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:40,665
tracking you right now,
so just lay low, please.

332
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,336
- That's what I'm talking about, all right.
- I'm chilling.

333
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:49,799
And if I find something,
I'll buzz you.

334
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:52,468
Copy. Ben?

335
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,638
You're not going
to the golf tournament

336
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,265
dressed like Big Lebowski,
are you?

337
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,601
I fucking hate golf.

338
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:20,496
You're gonna miss.

339
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,583
He's gonna miss.

340
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,087
Look at him, he buys this fancy

341
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,048
Scotty Cameron prototype,
thinks it's gonna fix his game.

342
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,344
The man's a genius, you know,
but I keep telling him,

343
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,471
you can't buy feel.

344
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:42,703
How was your flight over? Did
they treat you right up there?

345
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:45,271
Did you get friendly
with a minxy little stewardess?

346
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,065
I doubt Elias flew 13 hours
to talk about

347
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,026
sexually harassing
flight attendants.

348
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,610
I'm not talking
about harassment.

349
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:54,196
I am talking about
the natural magnetism

350
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,407
of having God-money.

351
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,743
Mr. Agnon.

352
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,828
Always good for a laugh.

353
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,371
I'm not kidding.

354
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:03,914
Plano is one of, what?

355
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,541
Maybe four outfits on Earth

356
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,043
positioned to buy
Mike's company.

357
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:09,128
We'll make you a hell of a deal
on Nubellum.

358
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,796
Capstone Industries?

359
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,423
- You're on deck.
- Hey, excellent.

360
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,425
Uh, do we know
who we're paired with yet?

361
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,052
I asked for Bryson DeChambeau.

362
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,971
You are with Steve Davey.

363
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,931
Who the fuck is that?

364
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:23,476
No, no, no, no, no, no.

365
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,770
Come here, let me explain
something to you.

366
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,917
<i>And now teeing off
for Capstone Industries</i>

367
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,277
<i>is Bryson DeChambeau.</i>

368
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,812
I'm not ashamed
to admit we considered

369
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,648
very seriously
an offer six years ago.

370
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:11,899
I had no idea.

371
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,651
Your work has always
been very impressive.

372
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,653
I really appreciate that.

373
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,780
Before Capstone took us
into military contracts,

374
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,074
I had a different plan
for Nubellum.

375
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,159
And if this sale goes through,

376
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,595
maybe we can explore
that original concept.

377
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:26,497
There he goes! Getting excited.

378
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,084
The thing about visionaries...

379
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:33,254
they see an endless
spectrum of possibilities.

380
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,424
Our job as partners, as patrons,

381
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:39,844
has been to narrow
that band just a bit.

382
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,887
Once Capstone came on board,

383
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,931
once Steve started steering

384
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:47,309
the ship, well,
that's why we're here, isn't it?

385
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,894
Hmm.

386
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,939
I do prefer your current
orientation, Mr. Tedesco.

387
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,941
Uh, of course. Right.

388
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,193
That mean Plano's ready
to counter?

389
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:00,114
Mr. Agnon,
I appreciate your perseverance,

390
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:02,366
but this was by design...

391
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,076
a social visit.

392
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,203
Social. Mm-hmm. Okay.

393
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,872
How about this?

394
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,709
I rented a house off the 16th.

395
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,295
How about I drum up
a little soirée tonight?

396
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,505
Call some friends, some girls.

397
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:19,383
I got a bottle of Bas-Armagnac
that'll knock you flat.

398
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,761
Then I'll throw
some fresh numbers at you.

399
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:24,138
If I'm in the ballpark, great.

400
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,724
If not,
we'll always have Bryson.

401
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,810
Hmm.

402
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:33,397
This... house,
you said, uh, it is where?

403
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,736
Yeah.

404
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,821
Yeah, I got eyes on.

405
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,866
Easy day, brother.

406
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,785
Easy day.

407
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,870
Yeah.

408
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,187
Excuse me, guys.

409
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,439
- Hello?
- Hey, Jord, it's me.

410
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,149
<i>Katie. Shit.
I've been calling you.</i>

411
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,442
What happened yesterday?

412
00:31:00,526 --> 00:31:02,903
Yeah, sorry.
You know, I lost my phone.

413
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,446
<i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

414
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,448
Uh, listen.

415
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,033
I was wrong on the Reece story.

416
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,660
I was all wrong.

417
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,903
What do you mean "all wrong"?

418
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:12,705
Um...

419
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:14,724
you know, I think I got
to get out of town for a bit.

420
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,585
I'm... I'm just
kind of burnt out, you know?

421
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,295
<i>No. No, I don't know.</i>

422
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,088
<i>W-What are you talking about?</i>

423
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,591
You're doing this, aren't you?

424
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:25,259
<i>You're fucking bailing
on me, right?</i>

425
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:26,635
Sorry, Jord.

426
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,596
<i>- You've been good to me.</i>
- Goddammit, Katie.

427
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,479
So this is what I get
for trusting you, for...

428
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,909
So...

429
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,203
how are we faring in here?

430
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:54,955
This is good work.

431
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,457
We'll get there.

432
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,126
Mm.

433
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,340
I didn't hire you to pussyfoot.

434
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,682
This is going to get us down
to '05 levels.

435
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:15,851
That's right.

436
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,315
Some would say it's unwise

437
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:24,693
to unilaterally
stand down resources.

438
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:29,490
Would you say it's unwise?

439
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:34,078
Lorraine,
you have four months left,

440
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,205
and frankly, this might not

441
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,790
make it past committee.

442
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:40,292
You really want
to end on a loss?

443
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,296
Then we'll whip the votes.

444
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,340
It's a win for at least
half the chamber.

445
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,467
What about our contractors?

446
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,219
Think they'll see it as a win?

447
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:51,845
Well, if you're
trying to convince me

448
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,323
to feel sorry
for special interests...

449
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,349
They have power.

450
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,101
Which means they have a say.

451
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,063
And your legacy is fully intact
without creating headwinds.

452
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,399
Right.

453
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:06,151
This is my legacy.

454
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:09,154
Leaving things better
than when I found them.

455
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:02,040
Yeah.

456
00:34:02,124 --> 00:34:05,085
Something's happening out here.
Thought you'd want to know.

457
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:31,570
Hey, sweetheart.

458
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,364
I'm Raven.

459
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,244
- You want some company?
- Hi, Raven.

460
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,747
I do, in fact.

461
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,212
You know, I saw you walk in.

462
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,173
My girl Sasha wanted
to come over here and...

463
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,092
I said, "No, no. He's all mine."

464
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:56,303
- You said that, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

465
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:59,389
What do you say we, um...

466
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:02,643
go in the back
and have a drink in private?

467
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:05,062
Why don't we sit here and talk?

468
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,439
Oh, I love to talk.

469
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:13,320
What are we talking about?

470
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,364
I'm looking to party.

471
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,491
Think you could help me out?

472
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,455
You a cop?

473
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:24,748
Hmm.

474
00:35:24,832 --> 00:35:26,166
No.

475
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,418
You know you have
to tell me if you are.

476
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,254
I'm not sure that's true.

477
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,297
But I'm not.

478
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,010
I can hook you up.

479
00:35:37,094 --> 00:35:39,179
What exactly
are you looking for?

480
00:35:39,263 --> 00:35:41,682
- I've been having headaches.
- Oh, yeah?

481
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,642
How bad?

482
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:45,644
Real bad.

483
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,440
Well, the DJ's got
some methadone wafers.

484
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:51,900
Think that'll do the trick?

485
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,571
I think that'd do the trick.

486
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,823
It's $100 each.

487
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,075
And it's a really

488
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,660
good price for you.

489
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,912
Just for me?

490
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,547
Thank you, baby.

491
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,716
Sit tight.

492
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,401
Come on, boss,
what're you doing?

493
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,862
- Come on, boss.
- Let's go, man!

494
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,324
Let's go, get over here, Reece!

495
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:41,700
Hey, baby.

496
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,994
Everything okay?

497
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:50,500
I'm just remembering.

498
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,421
Well, this...

499
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,590
will help you forget.

500
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:17,527
Got to say, you never did

501
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,613
like this kind
of work downrange.

502
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,829
Downrange, we had rules.

503
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,207
Yeah, too many.

504
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:42,719
It was never
the same after you left.

505
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:48,183
Hell, I-I thought
about walking, too.

506
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,144
You and the teams,

507
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,313
you're like flowers
and fucking dirt, brother.

508
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:56,108
You weren't going anywhere, and
you certainly didn't need me.

509
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,908
I'm not sure that's true,
all things considered.

510
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:09,413
Hey...

511
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,498
let me take this.

512
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,295
What?

513
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:19,673
I'm gonna let
you have all the fun?

514
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,763
Well, someone's gonna
have a hell of a night.

515
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,893
- Here you go, ladies.
- Thank you.

516
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,396
No, no, no, no, no.

517
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:38,358
I am telling you,
it is the best sushi

518
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:41,111
you have ever had in your life.

519
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:43,196
Don't be ridiculous, please.

520
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,866
It's a fucking revelation
is what it is.

521
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,617
You want to talk about the best?

522
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:50,162
Have you been
to Sukiyabashi Jiro?

523
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,330
Oh, give me a break with Jiro!

524
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,000
He's fine.
He... he's good, whatever.

525
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,502
But Steve found
this guy, Ta is hi.

526
00:38:57,586 --> 00:39:00,464
We shipped this little guy
over from Hokkaido.

527
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:04,009
I'm telling you,
this fucking guy speaks fish.

528
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,969
He goes down to the pier,
he starts,

529
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:07,846
like, whispering
to the-the mackerels

530
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:10,724
and the skipjack, and I
don't know what they say back,

531
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:11,975
but it must mean, "Pick me,

532
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,819
I'm fucking delicious."

533
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:16,938
Sounds like something
I'll have to try.

534
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,107
Great. I'll make reservations.

535
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:20,609
When?

536
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,113
I don't have a time line.

537
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:26,907
I must speak to my board.

538
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,909
Fuck your board.

539
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,243
I'm asking you.

540
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:31,828
Saul, don't.

541
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,458
It's late.

542
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,960
And as much as I've
enjoyed myself, I...

543
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:41,338
have a flight in the morning.

544
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,884
Elias, we've been
dancing for months.

545
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,803
You want to golf?

546
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,679
We're golfing.
You want to eat fish?

547
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:51,765
<i>Irasshaimase.</i>

548
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,184
But we've reached the point,
my friend,

549
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:56,645
where I must compel you
to either

550
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,563
shit or get off the pot.

551
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:01,525
Does Plano want Nubellum or not?

552
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:09,908
I'll call our acquisitions team.

553
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,410
Tell Mr. Horn
that I'll have a proposition

554
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,037
by morning.

555
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:16,123
Good night.

556
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:28,009
That was out of line.

557
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,011
A man
like Elias Ryberg should be

558
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:32,389
treated with respect,
not disdain.

559
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,270
Do you have
the slightest concept

560
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,772
how much money I just made you?

561
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,108
Jesus Christ, Mike.

562
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:46,403
You should be
fucking thanking me.

563
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:51,491
All right, all of you.

564
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:53,201
Can I have your attention,
please?

565
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,537
Everybody...

566
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,873
fuck off.

567
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:00,083
I mean it, you're done. Go home.

568
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,169
Everybody, you're done. Go.

569
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,253
Seriously?

570
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,838
Yes.

571
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:14,407
We made a lot
of money today, buddy.

572
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:17,077
We made a lot of money today,
buddy.

573
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,204
Who's my baby?

574
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,126
Ah...

575
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:55,193
There he is.

576
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:21,737
- I'll tell you, that thing with the bag, Saul.
- Please...

577
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,888
- Please!
- Listen.

578
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:26,224
Hey, that thing
with the bag, that was,

579
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:30,228
that was unpleasant
for both of us. Okay?

580
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,147
Help! Help me!

581
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,024
Help me! Somebody, please!

582
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:38,111
Help! Help...

583
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,366
Help! Somebody!

584
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,452
Help me...

585
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:49,789
Help...

586
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,794
You done?

587
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,687
Why does Capstone Industries
want me dead?

588
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:17,484
I-I...

589
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:20,212
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Okay, don't fucking lie to me.

590
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:23,072
I'm not lying, I swear
on my mother's fucking grave!

591
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:24,991
Does it have something
to do with the tumor?

592
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:27,076
What?

593
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,745
The tumor in my head, Saul.

594
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:30,497
You have a fucking brain tumor?

595
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,290
Goddamn it.

596
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:35,126
Un-fucking-tie me.
I didn't do anything.

597
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:49,974
You know, I've seen men
withstand horrible things, Saul.

598
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,228
Pain.

599
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:56,523
Degradation.

600
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,236
The likes of which
you can't possibly imagine.

601
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,447
And they kept their mouth shut.

602
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:06,908
Because those men
believed in something.

603
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,993
They had a purpose
greater than themselves.

604
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:11,329
A cause that they'd sooner die

605
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:16,042
screaming for than to sell out.

606
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,129
That's not you though,
is it, Saul?

607
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:21,839
You're not a true believer.

608
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,675
You're just... you're a guy

609
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,052
who stumbled ass-backwards
into a world

610
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,804
that he does not understand.

611
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:29,889
You do not want to die

612
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:32,475
for this, Saul.

613
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,561
So tell me.

614
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,607
He does...
He doesn't...

615
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,609
he doesn't tell me anything.

616
00:47:41,693 --> 00:47:44,862
- Who?
- It's data isolation.

617
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:47,407
Compartmentation.
Same as you guys.

618
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,993
- He gets off on that shit.
- Who gets off on that shit?

619
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,290
Steve.

620
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,334
Horn.

621
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:01,087
Steve Horn. There you go.

622
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,465
Get you a little sip.

623
00:48:12,015 --> 00:48:13,891
Go on.

624
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:16,269
- Steve's a visionary.
- He, uh...

625
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,396
...he made this fortune
in tech and then

626
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,274
he-he moved over into VC.

627
00:48:21,357 --> 00:48:23,443
He, uh, understands people,

628
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,654
markets, war.

629
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:31,743
I-I'm just an appendage.

630
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:35,079
A go-between. I resolve things.

631
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,958
How does Steve execute
an ambush in Syria?

632
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,669
Steve has friends everywhere.

633
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:43,963
Perks of being a billionaire.

634
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:45,727
- What was his objective?
- Look, that's...

635
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:48,509
that's not my department,
but, um...

636
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:51,179
it's all
about something called, uh...

637
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:56,059
...Project RD-4895.

638
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:59,604
- What's that?
- RD-4895.

639
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:03,066
But I'm telling you,
I don't know what it is.

640
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,569
I-I-I just know
that it's worth a...

641
00:49:06,653 --> 00:49:08,821
a lot of money.

642
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:12,033
That's not good enough.

643
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,954
No! Come on! Come on!

644
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:19,248
Listen, man,
I'm telling you, man!

645
00:49:19,332 --> 00:49:21,000
I don't know anything!

646
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,877
I'm just a guy!
You said it yourself!

647
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,712
I'm just a fucking guy!

648
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:36,474
All right.

649
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:38,476
All right, I believe you.

650
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:42,313
Steve Horn calls the shots
and you are

651
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:44,273
- his little errand bitch.
- Yes!

652
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:46,025
- Right.
- Yes! That's it.

653
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:47,485
You don't make decisions.

654
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,362
You didn't want any of this
to happen.

655
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,614
I swear to Christ.

656
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:53,282
Who did you send

657
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,576
to kill my family?

658
00:49:57,412 --> 00:49:59,414
Hmm?

659
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:05,670
Have a little more.

660
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,755
I want to go home, man.

661
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,220
I asked you a question.

662
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:24,981
There's a...

663
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,277
There's a lawyer
out of Jackson Hole.

664
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,237
Marcus Boykin.

665
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,990
He deals in black market
crude all over the globe,

666
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,325
including Mexico.

667
00:50:36,409 --> 00:50:38,411
Mexico?

668
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:42,999
Boykin hired sicarios.

669
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,209
The trigger man.

670
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:47,003
The one who got away.
Where do I find him?

671
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:48,796
Fucking Mexico,
I just said that.

672
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,174
- Be specific.
- "What's the address of the sicario?"

673
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,634
That's not
a fucking question you ask.

674
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:55,636
- Does Boykin know?
- Boykin doesn't know shit.

675
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,639
He knows routing numbers for...

676
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,810
...incompetent fucking hit men.

677
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,230
He's more useless than me.

678
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:13,863
You know, downrange
we like to say

679
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:15,406
that what we do is for freedom.

680
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,909
But what it really is, Saul...

681
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:20,453
There's evil...

682
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:23,247
in this world.

683
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,750
It's our job
to look it in the eye,

684
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,543
'cause most folks
don't have the balls.

685
00:51:27,627 --> 00:51:29,504
That's the job. We do it.

686
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,380
All you got to do
is pay your taxes

687
00:51:31,464 --> 00:51:33,508
and stay out of our way,
but you...

688
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,635
Saul...

689
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,553
Steve Horn,

690
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:40,890
Capstone Industries...

691
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,685
...oh, you wanted
in on the fray.

692
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,689
Now...
you're on the battlefield.

693
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:55,238
This is a methadone cocktail,
Saul.

694
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:57,490
You get a quiet death.

695
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,575
And you're lucky.

696
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:02,203
It's more than you deserve.

697
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,288
Shh.

698
00:54:09,705 --> 00:54:11,749
We were looking
at a place in Tahoe.

699
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,292
I tell you that?

700
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,337
A little cabin
on the west shore.

701
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:18,756
Lauren had this plan.

702
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,258
She was gonna train
athletes at altitude.

703
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:24,136
Lucy wanted to live somewhere
she could see all the stars.

704
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:31,936
That's it.
That's all they wanted.

705
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,981
Dead...

706
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,108
they get nothing.

707
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:39,694
They get darkness.

708
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:43,030
In service
of some corporate project.

709
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:47,785
That's why my wife
and daughter had to die.

710
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,789
This is what I don't get.

711
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:55,126
Why did they have to bring
the girls into this?

712
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:00,631
An assassination would
make waves.

713
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:05,469
If a combat veteran goes nuts,
kills his family,

714
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:07,346
kills the doctors,
kills himself,

715
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,266
people don't blink.

716
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,644
They needed it
to be more digestible.

717
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:17,982
Steve Horn,
he's in San Francisco.

718
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:20,401
Head of the snake.
He can get me

719
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,111
the truth on RD-4895.

720
00:55:22,194 --> 00:55:23,529
But Boykin?

721
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,865
That's our path
to the trigger man.

722
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,950
The one
who killed Lauren and Lucy.

723
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:30,286
All right.

724
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,705
Answers or blood.

725
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,791
Shooter's choice.

726
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:42,465
Blood.
