706
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:51,679
- Show me your arms.
- I didn't kill anyone.

707
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:54,455
Show me your arms.

708
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,381
Turn your left arm over.

709
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:11,222
Turn your other arm over.

710
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:19,731
Okay.

711
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,650
Okay.

712
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:28,615
Maybe you didn't kill them,
but you covered it up.

713
00:48:28,698 --> 00:48:29,824
Who do you work for?

714
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,493
Put your fucking hands in.

715
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:39,167
I asked you a question.

716
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:41,127
[grunts]

717
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,545
[crying]

718
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:44,589
Don't fucking cry.

719
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,633
Iran?

720
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:47,925
Syria?

721
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:50,428
[whimpering]

722
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:52,305
Don't you fucking make me
ask you again.

723
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:53,931
Who do you work for?

724
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,976
<i>[Boozer] Come on.
This is getting boring, boss.</i>

728
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:14,202
but we know
what we fucking know.

729
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,830
There ain't no question we got
all four aces on this turd.

730
00:49:17,914 --> 00:49:20,667

733
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:31,302
Fuck.

734
00:49:31,386 --> 00:49:33,012
Not right now, goddamn it.

735
00:49:33,096 --> 00:49:35,014
He's got amnesia, boss.

736
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:37,350
[Jaafar] I beg you, I beg you.

737
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,496
<i>- [Holder] Commander?</i>
- Why can't you just be straight with me?

738
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,647
<i>[Holder] Commander,
who are you talking to?</i>

739
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,733
Listen, okay? Just listen.

740
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,402
I'll-I'll... I won't charge you.

741
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,405
I-I'll just... it all goes away.

742
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,949
- Oh, it just goes away?
- Yes.

743
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,493
You took my thumbprint
off of SEAL biometrics.

744
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:58,162
I was doing my job.
I was assisting on Odin's Sword.

745
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:05,461
- You fucked up.
- Commander,

746
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:06,963
I'm a federal agent.

747
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:08,339
A federal agent.

748
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,091
But I dialed 911.
That's the police.

749
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,844
There's no fucking way
you would be first on the scene.

750
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,887
No. Not unless
you were already there.

751
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,097
Dispatch called us.

752
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,349
They know you're Navy.
Of course they called us.

753
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:19,892
They know you're Navy.

754
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:24,689
Don't lie to me.

755
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:26,733
I'm not.

756
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:29,110
[sharp ringing]

757
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:32,113
Fuck. Come on, goddamn it.

758
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,240
I fucking knew it at Boozer's

759
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:36,075
'cause I knew he didn't
fucking kill himself

760
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,161
and I knew it in the tunnels
with Alpha Platoon

761
00:50:38,244 --> 00:50:39,787
and I fucking know it now. Okay?

762
00:50:39,871 --> 00:50:43,541
- Commander...
- You fucking set me up.

763
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:44,751
You're unwell.

764
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,627
- [ringing continues]
- [grunts]

765
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,796
[distant] You're unwell.

766
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,174
You're unwell.

767
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:54,469
If what you say is true,

768
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:57,764
then there is no assassin.

769
00:50:57,847 --> 00:50:59,891
Then I killed my family.

770
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,561
No. No.

771
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:05,772
Fuck.

772
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,336
You can convince me
of a lot of things,

773
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:12,379
but you can't
convince me of that.

774
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,697
Commander, no, don't.

775
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,175
- Don't.
- Don't fucking move. Lift your chin up.

776
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,159
- No!
- Lift your fucking chin up.

- [groans]
- What are you saying?

781
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:31,714
Saul Agnon, he... this guy,
he's the guy who pays me.

782
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,341
- What?
- That's his name.

783
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:36,886
He gives me information,
I-I get money in-in an account.

784
